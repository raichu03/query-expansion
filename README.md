# Query Expansion with LLMs
This repository contains code for finetuning a T5 language model to perform query expansion using a dataset of queries and their expanded versions.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training is a collection of queries and their expanded versions, which can be found in `all_queries.csv`. The dataset is structured with two columns: `query` and `expanded`.
